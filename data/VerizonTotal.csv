ASUS,ZenFone V,2019-03-01,2019-08-09," Verizon Wireless is pleased to announce a software upgrade to Android 8.0 for your Zenfone V. Picture-in-Picture mode Android 8.0 allows activities to launch in picture-in-picture (PIP) mode. PIP is a special type of multi-window mode mostly used for video playback. PIP mode was originally available for Android TV only; Android 8.0 makes the feature available on other Android devices. Notifications In Android 8.0, we've redesigned notifications to provide an easier and more consistent way to manage notification behavior and settings. Text Field Form Autofill Account creation, login, and credit card transactions take time and are prone to errors. Users can easily get frustrated with apps that require these types of repetitive tasks. Android 8.0 makes filling out forms, such as login and credit card forms, easier with the introduction of the Autofill Framework. Existing and new apps work with Autofill Framework after the user opts in to autofill. Multi-display support Beginning with Android 8.0, the platform offers enhanced support for multiple displays. If an activity supports multi-window mode and is running on a device with multiple displays, users can move the activity from one display to another. When an app launches an activity, the app can specify which display the activity should run on. App categories Android 8.0 allows each app to show a category that it fits into when relevant. These categories are used to cluster together apps of similar purpose or function when presenting them to users, such as in Data Usage, Battery Usage, or Storage Usage.

Motorola,g6,2019-06-01,2019-07-10," Android 9.0 Pie improves your mobile experience, from the new Intuitive Navigation and Recent App, an improved Do Not Disturb mode, and a colorful settings menu, to an anticipated longer battery life and revamped split-screen. Android Pie also brings a redesigned Quick Settings, simplified volume controls, an easier way to manage notifications and more. After installing the software update you may notice changes that include: Usability Adaptive Battery: Get more from a single charge. Adaptive Battery prioritizes power on the apps you use the most and applies restrictions on the ones you use the least. Battery saver can now be activated from 70% or below. Adaptive Brightness: Fewer manual adjustments for better performance. Machine learning takes note of your habits and automatically adjusts to your activities. Quick settings improvements: No shortcuts (toggles are no longer expandable, but pressing and holding a toggle goes to setting detail). The icons have been redesigned with a rounded concept and circular background. Rotation key: Android Pie presents a temporary rotation even with the auto-rotate disabled. A rotation button is displayed whenever it detects your phone has changed orientation. Redesigned Settings app: Colorful icons for each selection with a circular background. It also warns if the phone is muted or in Do Not Disturb mode. Order, name and placement of the settings options haven't changed. Better Screenshots: Another handy Android 9.0 feature is the addition of the virtual screenshot button/shortcut to the power menu (the old ""Power + Volume Down"" method still works). You can also edit your screenshots immediately after taking them and a delete option is also available. Improved audio controls: The volume slider is now vertical and close to the volume buttons. You can switch between Ring, Mute, and Vibrate Only mode. Plus, media controls now default to volume adjusted and Do Not Disturb cannot be turned on/off via the volume keys anymore. Bluetooth® device volumes are also accessed whenever connected. As usual, ""Volume Up + Power"" changes the ring mode to Vibrate. Zoom in text: You can finally manage the annoying mistakes of selecting incorrect text. Now, when you long press a phrase or text, it will automatically magnify at the pointer.

Dragging the split screen border will select the app you want in Full screen. Notifications Notification UI changes: Notifications now have rounded corners. It also supports inline images/stickers and distinguishes between single/group conversations. Dismissing Notifications: Android Pie will now suggest to you a couple of actions for the types of notifications you usually dismiss.

Power efficiency: Refinements to Doze, App Standby, and Background Limits to improve battery life. Background App privacy: This system restricts access to your phone's microphone, camera, and other sensors (other than GPS). A persistent notification is shown if an app needs access while in the background. Bluetooth enhancements: Simultaneous connection of up to 5 Bluetooth audio devices. However, there is no option for simultaneous playback; you need to choose the device to be used. Also, Android 9.0 remembers the last volume level for paired devices. Wi-Fi optimization: Wi-Fi hotspot turns OFF when there is no connection. It disables automatically, preventing others nearby from connecting to your network. Security Security enhancements: An alert tone will sound when a call is being Recorded to all parties. Also the Pattern unlock, instead of simply leaving the trail visible, hides the swipe trail until the phone has fully unlocked. This is better for security. Data encryption: Android Pie will now perform client-side data encryption and/or decryption on your phone. Authentication is required (password, PIN, pattern), plus Google backs up all information to the cloud, and hacker attacks become much more difficult. DNS over TLS support: This creates a secure connection to the DNS server before DNS queries and responses happen. For example, someone monitoring the connection will have a harder time seeing what you're doing. HTTPs by default: All applications built for Android Pie onwards will send and receive data via HTTPS by default, ensuring that your data is better protected as you communicate with the app's servers, especially public Wi-Fi.

Adaptive Brightness: Fewer manual adjustments are necessary for better performance. Machine learning takes notes of your habits and automatically adjusts to your activities. Quick settings improvements: No shortcuts anymore (Toggles are no longer expandable, but pressing and holding a toggle goes to setting detail). The icons have been redesigned with a rounded concept and circular background. Rotation key: Android Pie presents a temporary rotation even with the auto-rotate disabled.

You can also edit your screenshots immediately after taking them and a delete option is also available. Improved audio controls: The volume slider is now vertical and close to volume buttons. You can switch between Ring, Mute, and Vibrate only mode. Plus, media controls are now the default volume adjusted and Do not disturb cannot be turned on/off via volume keys anymore.
